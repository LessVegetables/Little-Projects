# Little Projects Collection

Welcome to my collection of small projects! This repository contains various independent projects, each stored in its own directory. Every project has its own `README` file and may have a unique license.

## Repository Structure
Each project is stored in a separate folder, and these projects are unrelated to each other. Within each project directory, you will find:
- A `README.md` file that describes the project.
- A `LICENSE` or `UNLICENSE` file that specifies the license under which the code is released.
- Any assets (images, sounds, etc.) that the project may use.

## License Information
Each project is licensed independently. Some may be under the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/) or a different open-source license. **Please refer to the specific project's `README` and `LICENSE` files for the exact licensing terms.**

### Code Licensing
In general, most projects here will release the code under a very permissive license like the Unlicense, allowing you to use, modify, and distribute the code without restriction.

### Assets Licensing
While the code is usually freely available, the assets used in these projects (such as images, sounds, or music) may not be covered under the same license. Each project's `README` will specify the licensing terms for the assets it uses.

## How to Contribute
If you'd like to contribute to any of these projects, feel free to fork the repository, submit a pull request, or open an issue. Contributions are always welcome, but keep in mind the individual licenses for each project.

## Projects
- [Project 1: Redlight Greenlight](./Redlight-Greenlight/README.md) - A motion detection game inspired by Squid Game.

(More projects will be added here as the collection grows.)
